# Qiuth

**Multi-Factor Authentication for API Keys** - Stop treating API keys like passwords.

> **Qiuth** transforms API keys from bearer tokens into proof-of-possession tokens, requiring multiple authentication factors to prevent unauthorized access even if your API key is leaked.

Pronounced **chew-auth**. Inspired by [Kevin Qiu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinmqiu)

---

## The Problem

**API keys are single points of failure.** If your API key is leaked (committed to GitHub, intercepted in transit, stolen from logs), an attacker has **unlimited access** to your API.

```bash
# Your .env file accidentally committed to GitHub
API_KEY=sk_live_abc123def456

# Attacker finds it and has full access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123def456" https://api.yourapp.com/data
# SUCCESS - Attacker downloads all your data
```

**This happens more often than you think:**
- Thousands of API keys leaked on GitHub every day
- `.env` files accidentally committed to public repos
- API keys logged in error messages or monitoring tools
- Keys intercepted in transit or stolen from compromised systems
- Even with key pairs, if the private key is leaked, it's game over

---

## The Solution

**Qiuth adds multi-factor authentication to your API keys**, transforming them from bearer tokens (anyone with the key can use it) into **proof-of-possession tokens** (you need the key PLUS additional factors).

### Three Layers of Defense

1. **IP Allowlisting** - First line of defense
   - Verify requests come from authorized locations
   - Support for IPv4/IPv6 CIDR notation
   - Blocks unauthorized networks immediately

2. **TOTP MFA** - Time-based one-time passwords
   - Works for service accounts (programmatic)
   - Tokens change every 30 seconds
   - Even if API key is leaked, attacker needs TOTP secret

3. **Certificate Authentication** - Cryptographic proof
   - Requires private key to sign each request
   - Prevents replay attacks with timestamp validation
   - Even if API key + TOTP are leaked, attacker needs private key

### Real-World Impact

**After Qiuth:**
```bash
# API key leaked in GitHub
API_KEY=sk_live_abc123def456

# Attacker tries to use it
curl -H "X-API-Key: sk_live_abc123def456" https://api.yourapp.com/data
# FAILED: 401 Unauthorized - IP not in allowlist

# Attacker would need ALL THREE:
# 1. API key (leaked)
# 2. TOTP secret (stored separately)
# 3. Private key (never leaves secure environment)
# = Virtually impossible to compromise
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install qiuth
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { QiuthConfigBuilder, QiuthAuthenticator, generateKeyPair } from 'qiuth';

// Generate certificate key pair for maximum security
const { publicKey, privateKey } = generateKeyPair({ modulusLength: 2048 });

// Configure all three security layers
const config = new QiuthConfigBuilder()
  .withApiKey('your-api-key')
  .withIpAllowlist(['192.168.1.0/24'])
  .withTotp('your-totp-secret')
  .withCertificate(publicKey) // Add certificate-based authentication
  .build();

// Authenticate requests
const authenticator = new QiuthAuthenticator();
const result = await authenticator.authenticate({
  apiKey: 'user-provided-key',
  clientIp: '192.168.1.100',
  totpToken: '123456',
  signature: 'base64-signature', // Required when using withCertificate
  timestamp: Date.now().toString(),
  method: 'GET',
  url: 'https://api.example.com/resource',
}, config);

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Authentication successful!');
} else {
  console.error('Authentication failed:', result.errors);
}
```

**Note:** Use `.withCertificate(publicKey)` for maximum security. This requires clients to cryptographically sign each request with their private key, providing proof-of-possession that prevents unauthorized access even if API keys and TOTP secrets are compromised.

### Express Middleware

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { createQiuthMiddleware, QiuthConfigBuilder } from 'qiuth';

const app = express();

const qiuthAuth = createQiuthMiddleware({
  config: new QiuthConfigBuilder()
    .withApiKey('your-api-key')
    .withIpAllowlist(['0.0.0.0/0'])
    .withTotp('your-totp-secret')
    .build(),
});

app.get('/api/protected', qiuthAuth, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Access granted!' });
});
```

## Interactive Demo

**See Qiuth in action in 5 minutes!**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/clay-good/qiuth.git
cd qiuth

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the interactive demo
npm run demo
```

The demo server will start and display test credentials. Open a new terminal and try the test commands to see all three security layers in action!

**What you'll experience:**
- Level 1: Basic API key authentication
- Level 2: API key + IP allowlisting
- Level 3: API key + IP + TOTP MFA
- Level 4: Full security (all three layers)
- Failure scenarios (wrong credentials, expired tokens, invalid signatures)

## Use Cases

### 1. Service-to-Service Authentication
Secure microservices communication with MFA:
```typescript
const config = new QiuthConfigBuilder()
  .withApiKey(process.env.API_KEY)
  .withIpAllowlist(['10.0.0.0/8']) // Internal network
  .withTotp(process.env.TOTP_SECRET)
  .build();
```

### 2. API Key Management
Add MFA to your existing API key system:
```typescript
app.use('/api', createQiuthMiddleware({ config }));
```

### 3. Compliance Requirements
Meet PCI DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA security requirements:
```typescript
const config = new QiuthConfigBuilder()
  .withApiKey(apiKey)
  .withIpAllowlist(allowedIps)
  .withTotp(totpSecret)
  .withCertificate(publicKey) // Maximum security
  .build();
```

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Security
Secure automated deployments:
```typescript
// GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
const client = new QiuthClient({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  totpSecret: process.env.TOTP_SECRET,
  privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
});
```
